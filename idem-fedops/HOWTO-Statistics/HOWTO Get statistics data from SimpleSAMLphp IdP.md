# HOWTO Get statistics data from SimpleSAMLphp IdP

**This HOWTO is applicable for those who have enabled the Authentication Process Filter "[statistics:StatisticsWithAttribute](https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/contrib_modules/statistics/authproc_statisticswithattribute.html)" on the Identity Provider.**

To determine if your SimpleSAMLphp installation has the required Authentication Process Filter enabled, which is required by this HOWTO, check the following files:

* `metadata/saml20-idp-hosted.php`

Those who already use SimpleSAMLphp statistics module and `statistics:StatisticsWithAttribute` authentication process **do not need to follow this HOWTO**.
